# Basic-Network-Configuration-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

This project demonstrates a **basic network setup** using Cisco Packet Tracer. It is built under the guidance of great leaders behind **Tech Hierarchy**. 

--

## 📌 What This Project Includes

- A simple topology with:
  - 4 PCs  
  - 2 Switches  
  - 1 Router
- Cabling using **copper straight-through cables**
- Manual IP assignment for each PC
- Router interface configuration via **CLI mode**
- Basic testing with **Simple PDU (ping)** to verify connectivity

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to create and connect devices in Cisco Packet Tracer
- Configuring router interfaces using CLI (`interface`, `ip address`, `no shutdown`)
- Assigning IP addresses and default gateways to PCs
- Understanding the importance of subnetting and gateway routing
- Verifying network connectivity using **Simple PDU**

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Even though this is a basic task, it taught me the importance of:
- Hands-on practice over passive learning
- Starting small to build confidence
- Grasping foundational networking concepts before moving to complex architectures

---

## 📂 Files

  I have attached my model named **net config.pkt**
  (You can open the `.pkt` file with Packet Tracer)

## 🧠 Next Steps

This was just the beginning! I plan to explore:
- DHCP and DNS setup
- VLAN configuration
- Static and dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF)

## 🙌 A Note

If you're just starting out—keep going. Build small labs like this. Explore. Break. Rebuild. That's how real learning begins.
